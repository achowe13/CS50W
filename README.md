# CS50W
Repository of all the projects from the second certificate course from Harvard CS50W focusing on web based programming.

### My Girl Is Hungry
My capstone project for CS50W that uses Python, Django, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to cross reference user inputs of multiple ingredients with recipes currently in the database.  Also allows users to login/register, add new recipes, comment on recipes, and rate recipes.

### Search
First project for CS50W primarily using HTML with google itself on the back end to recreate google's search, image search, and advanced search options.

### Wiki
A wikipedia lookalike with many features of the original.

### Mail
An email service using JavaScript to provide functionality on one single page while switching views and making use of an API to do so without reloading the page or being brought to a different page.

### Commerce
This project is a functional prototype of Ebay allowing users to bid on items, add new items and add items to your watchlist.  Written in python with django framework.

### Network
Essentially a social media website where users can create posts, like posts, edit posts and follow other users.  Written in python with django framework with JavaScript.
